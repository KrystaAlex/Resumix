Resumix

Resumix is a personal resume builder that makes it easy to manage, customize, and export multiple resume versions for different job applicationsâ€”all in one clean, organized interface. This project was built to solve a real problem: constantly juggling multiple Google Docs, losing track of small changes, and wasting time reformatting resumes for each internship or job posting.

Resumix keeps one source of truth for your resume data while letting you quickly tailor each export version for a specific role or company.

ðŸš€ Mission

Customizing my resume for different applications is time-consuming and messy using Google Docs. Google Drive creates confusing version histories and duplicate PDFs that make tracking edits difficult. Resumix solves this problem by giving me a clean way to manage resume versions without losing control or clarity. This tool helps me work smarter and apply faster by keeping everything structured, consistent, and easy to update.
